            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Sweet Dreams Ice Cream Shop was founded in 2015 by Dipako, an ice cream enthusiasts who dreamed of bringing authentic, handcrafted gelato and ice cream to their community. What started as a small family business has grown into the most beloved ice cream destination in the city.</p>
            
            <p>Our journey began when Sarah, a pastry chef from Italy, met Dipako, a dairy farmer's son, during a culinary exchange program. Their shared passion for creating the perfect frozen dessert led them to experiment with traditional Italian gelato techniques combined with various flavors.</p>
            
            <p>Today, we're proud to serve over 30 unique flavors, each made with premium ingredients and a lot of love. We believe that ice cream brings people together, creates lasting memories, and adds sweetness to life's special moments.</p>
