            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Sweet Dreams Ice Cream Shop was founded in 2015 by Maria and Giuseppe Gelato, two ice cream enthusiasts who dreamed of bringing authentic, handcrafted gelato and ice cream to their community. What started as a small family business has grown into the most beloved ice cream destination in the city.</p>
            
            <p>Our journey began when Maria, a pastry chef from Italy, met Giuseppe, a dairy farmer's son, during a culinary exchange program. Their shared passion for creating the perfect frozen dessert led them to experiment with traditional Italian gelato techniques combined with local American flavors.</p>
            
            <p>Today, we're proud to serve over 30 unique flavors, each made with premium ingredients and a lot of love. We believe that ice cream brings people together, creates lasting memories, and adds sweetness to life's special moments.</p>
